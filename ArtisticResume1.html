		<P><H1>Summary of Content</H1></P>
		<P>I have been making art since I was a child.  I cannot remember a time when I wasn't.</p>
  <p> My art has matured over the last four decades and today I create fine art that challenges convential aesthetic sensibilities.</br/>
  I exercise a number of thought experiments in the genre of the Post-Modern, MetaModern, ReadyMyth, and Contemporary Art artistic sandboxes.<br/>
  The comprehensive resume listed below is a historical record of where and when I have exposed my art.
</P>
<p> This improbable and bodacious manifestation will attempt to once again redefine art in the digital space.
